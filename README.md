# Digital for macOS

## "Java got you steaming? Brew a fresh .DMG with ease!"

Are you a Mac user who's had one too many encounters with cryptic Java error messages? Does the mere thought of packaging Java apps for macOS brew up a headache? Fear not, fellow coder – salvation is at hand! Our magical script is like a caffeine shot for your build process, transforming those pesky JARs into DMG files with the grace of a barista perfecting their latte art.

### Quick Start
If you're just here to snag the latest release without getting your hands dirty, check out the **[DMG Image Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lxLDt8pSAzYrVImVnYJ3s-q18paBg1LQ/view?usp=sharing)** for the instant gratification download.

### Brew It Yourself
For those who like to grind their own beans (or in this case, build their own packages):

1. Clone this repository using `git clone` followed by a silent scream into the void.
2. Run the script and watch as it performs digital alchemy before your very eyes.
3. Sip your freshly packaged app, now in a smooth, full-bodied DMG format.

### Prerequisites:
- A Mac (obviously).
- Homebrew (the macOS package manager, not the DIY beer kit).
- A sense of humor (mandatory for reading this README).

### Disclaimer
While we've done our utmost to ensure that this script is as robust as an espresso, please remember that it's still software – and software, like humans, can sometimes have a bad day. If you encounter any issues, just open an issue and we'll get to it faster than you can say "Espresso macchiato"!

"Java development can be full of surprises, like a mystery flavor jelly bean. With this script, we guarantee the flavor is always 'Mac-licious'!"

Happy Brewing!
